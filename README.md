# Minimal AI Agent with LangGraph and Streamlit

A learning project exploring the capabilities of LangGraph for building AI agents and Streamlit for rapid UI development.

## Currently Features

- ü§ñ AI-powered chat interface using Anthropic's Claude model
- üîç Web search capabilities via Tavily Search API
- üí¨ Real-time message streaming
- üé® Clean, responsive UI built with Streamlit

## Prerequisites

- Python 3.8+
- Anthropic API key
- Tavily Search API key

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd <repository-name>
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Set up your API keys:
   - Get your Anthropic API key from [Anthropic Console](https://console.anthropic.com)
   - Get your Tavily API key from [Tavily AI](https://tavily.com)

## Usage

1. Run the Streamlit app:
```bash
streamlit run app.py
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to the provided local URL (typically http://localhost:8501)

3. Enter your API keys in the sidebar
4. Start chatting with the AI assistant!

## Important Notes

- Both Anthropic API and Tavily Search API keys are required for the application to function
- The application uses Claude 3.5 Sonnet as the default model
- Web search functionality is powered by Tavily Search API

## Future Improvements

- [ ] Add OpenAI API support as an alternative
- [ ] Make Tavily Search optional
- [ ] Enhance error handling
- [ ] Improve GUI/UX
- [ ] Add Ollama support for local LLM usage
- [ ] Implement MCP (Model Control Protocol) support
- [ ] Add conversation history management
- [ ] Implement better state management
